3D Printing Requirements:
The uploaded .stl files are optimized for FDM 3D printing using PLA material and have been tested on a Creality Ender 3 V3 SE 3D printer.

Print Specifications:

    - Material: PLA

    - Recommended Layer Height: 0.2 mm

    - Infill: 30–40% (for adequate strength)

    - Nozzle Size: 0.4 mm

    - Print Speed: 50–60 mm/s

    - Supports: Required for some parts (please refer to part-specific notes or inspect overhangs in your slicer)

    - Gear Ratio: 1:3 (Input:Output)

Ensure proper bed leveling and cooling for best print quality. You may also enable "brim" or "raft" for better adhesion if parts have small contact areas.
